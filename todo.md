# Transparent PNG Training and Generation with Flux.1 dev

## Tasks

- [x] Explore the Microsoft ART-MSRA GitHub repository
- [x] Analyze the provided attachments (ART_DONE.ipynb and flux_PNG_project.pdf)
- [x] Understand the ART-MSRA project architecture and components
- [x] Research the Flux.1 dev platform and its capabilities
- [ ] Design the training pipeline for transparent PNG images
- [ ] Implement the PNG training module using Flux.1 dev
- [ ] Implement VAE and Decoder saving functionality
- [ ] Implement transparent PNG image generation
- [ ] Develop ComfyUI nodes for loading and using the trained VAE and decoder
- [ ] Test and validate the solution
- [ ] Prepare final documentation

## Project Requirements

1. Train data from PNG images without background from: `/content/drive/MyDrive/SD-Data/TrainData/4000_PNG/TEST`
2. Save trained VAE and Decoder to: `/content/drive/MyDrive/VAE-DECODER`
3. Generate transparent PNG images (single layer) and save to: `/content/drive/MyDrive/VAE-DECODER/OUT`
4. Create ComfyUI nodes for loading and using the trained VAE and decoder
